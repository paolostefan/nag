## Nag Champa agarbathi

Nag Champa Agarbathi (नागचम्पा अगरबत्ती) literally means "the incense of the sacred Champaca tree" or "the incense of the Champaca flower".

"Nāga" refers to the sacred Nagara tree or spirit/breath, and "Champa" refers to the flower or the tree itself (the plumeria or Champaca tree), and "Agarbatti" is the Sanskrit word for a scented incense stick.

"Nagchampa agarbathi" refers to Nag Champa incense sticks, with "Nag" meaning "snake" and "Champa" referring to the fragrant Champaka flower found in India and Nepal. "Agarbathi" is the Hindi word for the incense sticks themselves, which are made from a blend of Champaka flower, sandalwood, and other natural resins. This popular Indian incense is known for its unique, rich, earthy, and slightly sweet aroma and is used for meditation, relaxation, and to create a calming, spiritually uplifting atmosphere.

Breaking down the terms:

- Nag: a Sanskrit word for "snake," sometimes thought to refer to sacred serpent deities, or the Nagara tree.
- Champa: refers to the Champaka flower (a golden magnolia), also known as Plumeria or the "snake flower".
- Agarbathi: the Hindi word for the incense sticks, which are hand-rolled around a bamboo stick.
